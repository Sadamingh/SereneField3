Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. — Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</blockquote><blockquote name="6770" id="6770" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</blockquote><blockquote name="f197" id="f197" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</blockquote><blockquote name="7cb3" id="7cb3" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.</blockquote><blockquote name="1b17" id="1b17" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</blockquote><blockquote name="51f5" id="51f5" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.</blockquote><blockquote name="f83f" id="f83f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.</blockquote><blockquote name="c20f" id="c20f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.</blockquote><blockquote name="c8a2" id="c8a2" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.</blockquote><blockquote name="d67c" id="d67c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.</blockquote><blockquote name="9b59" id="9b59" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.</blockquote><blockquote name="3fd2" id="3fd2" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.</blockquote><blockquote name="a90a" id="a90a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.</blockquote><blockquote name="7aa1" id="7aa1" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws;

perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.</blockquote><blockquote name="797e" id="797e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.</blockquote><blockquote name="b8e7" id="b8e7" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.</blockquote><blockquote name="1622" id="1622" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</blockquote><blockquote name="34c5" id="34c5" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.</blockquote><blockquote name="450b" id="450b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.</blockquote><p name="b55c" id="b55c" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--blockquote"><br></p><p name="cf66" id="cf66" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="9e1e" id="9e1e" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
