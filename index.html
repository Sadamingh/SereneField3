	<p> Hiya!</p>
	<p>My name is Adam Edelweiss. If you find my articles helpful, just share them with your friends! These articles are free for you to read, but you must not plagiarize them.</p>
	<p>Currently, I don’t accept any donations. If you would like to support me, you can simply give me some claps. It would be even better if you follow me or subscribe to me through your email.</p>
	<p>And because of the scammers and spams, you currently can not contact me by email. However, you can DM me through my twitter.</p>
	<p>Notice that you have to follow some rules before you contact me,</p>
	<li>Contact me only if you have some problems or concerns related to my articles. I would appreciate it if you have questions or suggestions.</li>
	<li>DON’T use my email for registrations. I got a lot of spam from Indonesia. STOP doing that.</li>
	<li>I will NOT answer the questions about your schoolwork and you should do it yourself.</li>
	<p>It takes some time for me to reply and please send me another email after 20 days if you do not receive the reply.</p>
	<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
